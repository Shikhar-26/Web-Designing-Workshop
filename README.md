Hello Myself Shikhar and this is the readme file  for my web designing project. I made a simple portfolio website using html & css only.
The project contains four different pages.
It uses css styling.
Float and Flexbox for layout.
In my skills section I have used three different cards for showcasing my skills.
I have also added the image used in the project.
